### About Me

With over 15 years of diverse professional experience spanning roles in commercial management, account representation, and project coordination, I've developed a robust skill set that uniquely positions me for success in software engineering.

My experience liaising directly with C-suite executives equipped me with strong communication skills and a keen understanding of client needsâ€”skills I've further honed through managing diverse projects and coordinating with cross-functional teams.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my extensive background in commercial management, project coordination, and client relations, together with my evolving skill set in software engineering, to contribute meaningfully to my new firm. I look forward to discussing how my unique blend of experiences aligns with the needs of your software engineering team. Please feel free to reach out to me at ohammad@gwu.edu.
