### About Me

With over 15 years of diverse professional experience spanning roles in commercial management, account representation, and project coordination, I've developed a robust skill set that uniquely positions me for success in software engineering.

Driven by a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world business challenges, I embarked on a transformative journey in software engineering. Graduating with distinction from the NYU Master's Bridge Program laid the foundation for my theoretical understanding, while my tenure as a Commercial Director at LOGIX MENA honed my strategic planning abilities and expertise in implementing CRM software to optimize operations and uncover hidden opportunities.

My experience liaising directly with C-suite executives at MARSH USA INC. equipped me with strong communication skills and a keen understanding of client needsâ€”skills I've further honed through managing diverse projects and coordinating with cross-functional teams.

Transitioning into software engineering, I complemented my practical experience with immersive training at the App Academy's 16-week program, where I honed my proficiency in coding languages such as Ruby and Javascript, along with frameworks like Rails, React, and the MERN Stack.

My journey also includes individual and collaborative projects, where I've seamlessly applied my project management expertise, solidified my proficiency in the Git workflow, and demonstrated an ability to thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my extensive background in commercial management, project coordination, and client relations, together with my evolving skill set in software engineering, to contribute meaningfully to my new firm. I look forward to discussing how my unique blend of experiences aligns with the needs of your software engineering team. Please feel free to reach out to me at ohammad@gwu.edu.
