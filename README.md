###About Me

Throughout my career, I've seen how technology, and more specifically, software, is used to solve real world business problems. It was through my repeated exposure to the solutions software provided that made me realize that engineering software solutions to real world problems is where my true passion lied. 

I started my journey into the Software Engineering industry by completing the NYU Master's Bridge Program with distinction, ultimately leading to my acceptance into their Masters in Computer Science Program. After consulting with mentors in the industry, I decided to pursue the boot camp route via App Academy where I could build the practical skills necessary to become a successful Software Engineer.

After App Academy's intensive 16 week in person program, I became proficient in coding languages such as Ruby and Javascript and frameworks such as Rails, React and the MERN Stack. I worked on projects both individually and in a group which equipped me the skills to work collaboratively and solidify my skills using the Git workflow.

In conclusion, NYU's Master's Bridge program provided me the theoretical background, whereas App Academy provided the practical. I would love to discuss my skills and qualifications with you further, so please feel free to email me at ohammad@gwu.edu
