### About Me

Driven by a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world business challenges, I embarked on a transformative journey in software engineering. Graduating with distinction from the NYU Master's Bridge Program laid the foundation for my theoretical understanding, leading me to the App Academy's immersive 16-week program. There, I honed my proficiency in coding languages such as Ruby and Javascript, along with frameworks like Rails, React, and the MERN Stack.

My experiences include both individual and collaborative projects, equipping me with the skills to work seamlessly within teams and solidify my proficiency in the Git workflow. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my evolving skill set, rooted in both theoretical knowledge and practical application, to contribute meaningfully to your company. I look forward to discussing how my background aligns with the needs of your software engineering team. Feel free to reach out to me at ohammad@gwu.edu.
